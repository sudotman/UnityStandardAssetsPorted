# UnityStandardAssetsPorted
Brings back Unity Standard Assets as an easy download for all Unity Versions.

## Why?
For some god awful reason, Unity has decided to remove all the downloadable links for the Standard Assets from their official Download Archive - alongside also replacing Standard Assets with the FPS and TPS Starter Assets which is fine but lacks a lot of the provided environments/particles. For future-proof archival and general ease-of-use, the standard assets have been uploaded using a standalone installion of Unity 2017.
